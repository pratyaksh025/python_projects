# Basic Notepad üìù  

This is a simple **Basic Notepad application** built with Python. It allows users to write, save, and load text files directly from the console.  

---

## How It Works  
1. When you run the program, a menu appears with options:  
   - **1. Write new text** ‚Üí Enter any text you want.  
   - **2. Save text** ‚Üí Saves the text into a file (`notes.txt`).  
   - **3. Load text** ‚Üí Loads and displays saved text from the file.  
   - **4. Exit** ‚Üí Closes the application.  

2. The file is stored at:  
    
    ```css
    file_destination = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),filename)
    ```


3. If you try to load text before saving, it will show **"No saved file found!"**
