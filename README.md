# Python_Projects  

A collection of **Python projects** structured by difficulty – Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced – covering concepts from basics to real-world applications.  

Each level (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced) will have **up to 50 projects**, designed to gradually strengthen problem-solving skills and programming expertise. The projects will cover all important **Python modules, libraries, and core concepts**, ensuring a comprehensive learning journey.  

This repository will also include **real-world projects** with proper documentation. Every project folder contains:  
- Python source code (`.py` file)  
- A well-written `README.md` explaining the project, usage, and future improvements
